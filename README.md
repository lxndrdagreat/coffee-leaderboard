# coffee-leaderboard
A coffee consumption leaderboard Slack integration. This was started as a fun
way for my Slack group to record our coffee consumption during the work day.

In Slack, when someone starts a message with the coffee emoji (`:coffee:`),
Slack sends the message on to the server which records the user. The records
are viewable via a leaderboard on the site's single page.
