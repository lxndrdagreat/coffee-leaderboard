# Coffee Leaderboard +XP

**Note: if you're interested in just the simple leaderboard, check out the 
`master` branch. **

This version of the leaderboard, which I refer to as "+XP", takes the base
leaderboard system and adds a simple, experience-based "leveling" system
on top of it.

## About the Leaderboard

A coffee consumption leaderboard Slack integration. This was started as a fun
way for my Slack group to record our coffee consumption during the work day.

In Slack, when someone starts a message with the coffee emoji (`:coffee:`),
Slack sends the message on to the server which records the user. The records
are viewable via a leaderboard on the site's single page.

## Requirements

- Python 3 (probably works in 2.7)
- MongoDB database and pymongo
- Flask
- pygal
